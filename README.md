# Service Oriented Architecture - Assessment 1

**CA Value:** 30%  
**Due Date:** 18th October 2024

## Project Overview

This project requires the development of an application in C# (console, desktop GUI, or web-based) that leverages at least two third-party web services (REST/JSON) within a specific domain. The goal is to create a fully functional application that demonstrates comprehensive use of the selected services, rather than simply displaying API functionalities.

### Project Requirements

- **Third-Party Services**: Use two distinct REST-based web services providing JSON responses.
- **Domain Context**: The application should serve a specific purpose within a defined domain, rather than act as a generic service demonstration.
- **Data Storage**: No database setup is required. Test data may be stored directly in code or in a text/JSON/XML file.
- **Optional**: Login/logout functionality, if desired.

### Key Concepts to Demonstrate

1. **Connecting to Web Services**: Successful integration and data handling from third-party services.
2. **Classes and Objects**: Including the use of abstract classes and interfaces.
3. **Arrays and ArrayLists**: Proper implementation of collection data structures.
4. **Booleans and Enums**: Use of control flow and enumerations.
5. **File Reading**: Reading data from external files as needed.

### Assessment Breakdown

| Criteria                          | Weight |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Complete functionality            | 50%    |
| Application Design and UI/UX      | 10%    |
| Class structure & organization    | 10%    |
| Use of specified constructs       | 10%    |
| Testing & general code quality    | 10%    |
| Overall impression/contextualization | 10% |

**Documentation:** Documentation should be included in the code or as a separate MS-Word file (maximum 3 pages).
